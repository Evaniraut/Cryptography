##  Project Overview  
This project presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a new cryptographic algorithm called the Inverted Key Cipher (IKC). The report includes background on classical ciphers, detailed algorithm steps, flowcharts, and testing results.

##  Objectives  
- Understand fundamental cryptography concepts  
- Develop a new encryption/decryption algorithm (IKC)  
- Test and evaluate the algorithm’s effectiveness and security  
- Provide thorough documentation for academic and practical use

## Contents  
- Introduction to cryptography and historical ciphers  
- Description of the Caesar Cipher as a baseline  
- Detailed explanation of the IKC algorithm: key generation, encryption, decryption  
- Flowcharts illustrating each step of the algorithm  
- Multiple test cases validating the algorithm  
- Critical evaluation of strengths and weaknesses  
- Conclusions and bibliography
